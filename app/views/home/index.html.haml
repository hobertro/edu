      %div
        Every time you push code, your teacher is automatically kept in the loop.
        No more emailing code or manually zipping and uploading files to a server.
    .benefit
      %h4
        Get feedback early and often.
        <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx=10 cy=10 r=8 /></svg>
      %div
        Professional programming is a continous process where software gets better through iterative
        testing and feedback cycles. Since your teacher is automatically synced with each and every update, you can apply these same real-world concepts to your class projects!
    .benefit
      %h4
        Build a rock-solid portfolio.
        <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx=10 cy=10 r=8 /></svg>
      %div
        All your code projects are created within your own personal account and credited to you.
        No need to work from forks or private teacher-owned organizations.
        Your final projects are great for demonstrating
        %em real world skills
        to potential employers.
    .benefit
      %h4
        Build skills using real-world collaborative workflows.
        <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx=10 cy=10 r=8 /></svg>
      %div
        Creating and owning your own projects on GitHub is great because there is automatically a historical record
        of all your iterative work over time. Your teacher is seen simply as a collaborator.
        Employers look for ability to work in a collaborative environment just as much if not more than coding ability alone.

      Narly monitors and analyzes code activity on repositories hosted on GitHub.
    %ol
      %li Teachers create a classroom in narly using their GitHub account.
      %li Students join the classroom using their GitHub account and specify their class project repositories.
      %li Narly monitors and aggregrates all activity on these repositories onto a classroom dashboard.
      %li Narly analyzes git metadata for deeper insight into activity over each project's lifecycle.

    %h5
      Narly works within the standard GitHub workflow.
    %p
      Both teachers and students are free to use their own personal GitHub accounts. 
      Code projects, privacy settings, and code-reviews are all managed within the normal GitHub workflow.

    %h2.title Notes on GitHub's fork strategy.

  .slide-content
    %p
      GitHub recommends the
      %a{ href: "https://education.github.com/guide/forks" } fork strategy
      which involves creating a skeleton repository for students to fork. Students commit their solution to their fork and submit it to the teacher by opening a pull-request on the primary repository.
      The teacher uses the pull-request interface to review code inline and assess the student's work.
    %p
      This works well when student assignments consist of solving a specific problem contained in a skeleton project.
      However, there are very important types of projects where the fork model quickly breaks down:
    %ul
      %li Final projects due at course-completion, which demonstrate skills learned and should be used to build the student's portfolio.
      %li Collaborative projects where students should own their collaborative environment specifically as a means to build their collaborative skills.
      %li Projects where you find it pertinent to privatize course-work between students -- all forkers of a repository can view the entire fork network.
    %p
      Projects students can add to their portfolio are one of the most valuable aspects of a course.
      But forked projects may send the wrong message:
    %ul
      %li Forked projects give the impression the code was not the student's original work.
      %li
        Forked projects do not count toward the student's
        %a{ href: "https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commit-was-made-in-a-fork" }
          GitHub statistics
        \.
    %p
      Narly empowers the <em>student</em> to create, maintain, iterate, and collaborate on his own projects just as he would in a professional environment.
